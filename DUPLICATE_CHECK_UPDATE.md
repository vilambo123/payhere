# üîç Duplicate Application Check - Updated

## What Changed

### Previous Behavior ‚ùå

- ‚úÖ Email
- ‚úÖ IC Number

### New Behavior ‚úÖ
Now checks for duplicates using:
- ‚úÖ Email
- ‚úÖ IC Number
- ‚úÖ Phone Number

## How It Works

### Duplicate Detection Logic

When a user submits a loan application, the system checks if there's already a **pending** application with:

```
Same Email  OR  Same IC Number  OR  Same Phone Number
```

If **any** match is found ‚Üí Application is rejected with a friendly message.

- Phone: +60 12-345-6789

New Submission:
- Email: john@example.com  ‚Üê MATCH!
- IC: 991234-12-9999
- Phone: +60 19-888-7777

```

## Important Notes

### 1. Only Checks PENDING Applications
- ‚úÖ Status = "pending" ‚Üí Blocks duplicate
- ‚úÖ Status = "contacted" ‚Üí Allows new application
- ‚úÖ Status = "approved" ‚Üí Allows new application
- ‚úÖ Status = "rejected" ‚Üí Allows new application

**Why?** Users can apply again after their previous application is processed.

### 2. Phone Number Formatting
The system automatically formats phone numbers for consistent matching:

```
User Input:        System Formats To:
012-345-6789   ‚Üí   +60 12-345-6789
0123456789     ‚Üí   +60 12-345-6789
+60123456789   ‚Üí   +60 12-345-6789
+6012-345-6789 ‚Üí   +60 12-345-6789
```

This ensures matches even if users enter phone numbers differently.

### 3. IC Number Formatting
IC numbers are also formatted:

```
User Input:        System Formats To:
901234123456   ‚Üí   901234-12-3456
901234-123456  ‚Üí   901234-12-3456
901234-12-3456 ‚Üí   901234-12-3456
```

### 4. Email Comparison
Emails are compared in lowercase:

```
john@example.com  =  JOHN@EXAMPLE.COM  =  John@Example.Com
```
